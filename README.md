# Shopping

## In this task, i would like to try to apply my knowledges of PostgreSQL with a simple example.

we habe buyers who want to buy the item. in the bayers table we have 4 columns wich consist of: id(bayers), name, email, balance(in dollars). in the items table we have 3 columns wich consist of: id(items), name, price(in dollars). we will also have a 3rd table that combines the data of the 1st table ande te 2nd, namely which buyer(his id) bought the item(item id).
